# satellite_simulation
Wolfram Mathematica code that simulates a falling satellite in Earth's atmosphere (educational purpose)

This is for high school and beginning physics students (or even physics laymen who are interested in physics). The code here simulates a satellite revolving 
around the Earth or an object falling on the Earth. Anybody with a personal computer and an internet connection can do these simulations.

========================

HOW TO USE THE CODE IN YOUR BROWSER (if you don't have Mathematica installed)?

1. Make a free account on https://www.wolframcloud.com/ and log into it.
2. Open a notebook (standard Wolfram notebook) after logging in.
3. Copy all the code (text) inside the file satellite_simulation_better_version_script_wolfram_cloud.txt on this Git repo and paste it into the notebook that you created in the previous step.
4. Go to the menu: Evaluation --> Evaluate All Cells. The code should run. Move the slider that appears horizontally to trace the trajectory.

============

HOW TO RUN THE CODE (if you have Mathematica installed)?

Just download the file satellite_simulation_better_version.nb, and run it by hitting Evaluation --> Evaluate Notebook.

Also, see this YouTube tutorial at https://youtu.be/K8ms_4SJh9Q to get an overall idea about what to expect. The video is made with a less sophisticated code.
