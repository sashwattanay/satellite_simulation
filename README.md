# satellite_simulation
Wolfram Mathematica code that simulates a falling satellite in Earth's atmosphere (educational purpose)

This is for high school and beginning physics students (or even physics laymen who are interested in physics). The code here simulates a satellite revolving 
around the Earth or an object falling on the Earth. Anybody with a personal computer and an internet connection can do these simulations.

How to use the code? See the YouTube tutorial at https://youtu.be/K8ms_4SJh9Q
